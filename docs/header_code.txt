Here is a breakdown of the general headers for a datafile from PSU:
The most important for friction modeling will be the following:
time_s, effns_mpa, mu, vdcdt_um, vobdcdt_um, hdcdt_um, hobdcdt_um, sstrain

time_s, the time during the experiment in seconds
recnum, the record number of collected data
sampfreq_hz, the sampling frequency used during the experiment
sync, the sync pulse used to align mechanical and acoustic data

hstress_mpa, the horizontal (normal) stress in MPa
hdcdt_um, the horizontal (normal) displacement in microns
hobdcdt_um, the on-board (direct) horizontal (normal) displacement in microns
hdtdt_um_dt, the horizontal (normal) displacement in mricons detrended for shear thinning
hobdtdt_um_dt, the on-board (direct) horizontal (normal) displacement in mricons detrended for shear thinning

vstress_mpa, the vertical (shear) stress in MPa
vdcdt_um, the vertical (shear) displacement in microns
vobdcdt_um, the on-board (direct) horizontal (vertical) displacement in microns
slipvel_ums, the slip velocity calculated using a simple moving window (rslope Leeman etal 2016)

laythick_um, the layer thickness for a single fault in microns
laythick_um_dt, the layer thickness detrended for a single fault in microns
sstrain, the shear strain for a single fault
effns_mpa, the effective normal stress in MPa (normal stress - pore pressure)
mu, the friction calculated for the material (shear stress / effective normal stress)

pcload_mpa, the confining pressure in MPa
pcdisp_um, the confining pressure intensifiers displacement in microns
ppaload_mpa, the pore pressure intensifiers called A in MPa
ppadisp_um, the pore pressure intensifiers called A displacement in microns
ppadisp_um_dt, the pore pressure intensifiers called A displacement detrended in microns
ppbload_mpa, the pore pressure intensifiers called B in MPa
ppbdisp_um, the pore pressure intensifiers called B displacement in microns
ppbdisp_um_dt, the pore pressure intensifiers called B displacement detrended in microns
